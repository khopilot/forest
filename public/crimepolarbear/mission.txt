Mission statement:



Blood: the red liquid that circulates in the arteries and veins of humans and other vertebrate animals, carrying oxygen to and carbon dioxide from the tissues of the body.

crimsonpolarbear© provides you with the knowledge, experience and drive to engage in all aspects of media production. 
First and foremost our focus is feature films, documentaries and television shows made with a purpose & soul.

Then there is the other stuff: music videos, commercials, multi media, branding, right on down the line, that serves another purpose. 

From concept to finish, we pull from our resources to mold a final product that stands apart from the competition. 

Our strive for excellence combined with cutting edge imagination has the crimsonpolarbear© run ahead of the (herd.)

There is nothing in this world that hasn’t been done already. What makes a difference is the spark of individuality in the haystack of commonality.
To get the best, you have to work with the best.  As crimsonpolarbear© grows we want to associate ourselves with products/ companies/ artists that light up the scene with their fusion of artistic quality and commercial appeal.




We are the connecting point between where you are and where you want to be.  

Nothing happens without blood, sweat and tears, and we here at
Crimsonpolarbear© bleed ourselves dry, to make you look good.
