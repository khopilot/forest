Final trilogy concept long version
(For the ACW holding page site)

ACW a trilogy or sorts.
The first film in the trilogy ACW: “Clever Creatures®” introduces us to Pim, Kith, and Chamron, orphans who go on a road trip- adventure searching for the family they never had. Not unlike Francois truffaut’s ; The Antoine Doinel cycle And/or Satyyajit Ray’s : The Apu Trilogy. 
The ACW trilogy centers around themes of family, self-discovery, and the power of love in an increasingly cold world. 
A significant highlight in the trilogy is watching the recurrence and evolution of Pim, played by the magnetic Cambodian actress of the same name. Pim stars in all three films, the audience will follow her journey with equal measures of joy, sadness, hope, regret, fate in a cinematic undertaking not seen since Richard Linklater’s Boyhood. 
“Hail Tiger King®”: picks up right after the events of “Clever creatures®”. Pim and Kith are living a new life of regret, and loss. A poetic look at how the consequences of the past effect the present, and what the future can be. Sad, but hopeful in a surreal fever dream. 
As Pim’s character evolves and shifts, so too does the films beautiful and haunting landscape. The third film in the trilogy, “Slowmotion Superstars®” makes a bold and seismic shift in tone and setting, light years ahead and set on an almost entirely different landscape. 
The trilogy was shot with the intent of being consumed as an interconnected, overarching epic, but was also crafted in a way that affords the audience the possibility of enjoying each film as a standalone work of art. 
“Hail Tiger King®” and  “Slowmotion Superstars®” are currently completing post production. Release dates are expected for 2025 through early 2026 respectively. 
Final trilogy concept short version 
(For the crimson polar bear site!)

The ACW® trilogy; “clever creatures®”,: is the first of the trilogy, not unlike
Francois truffaut’s ; The Antoine Doinel cycle And/or Satyyajit Ray’s : The Apu Trilogy

Pim is the lead actress in all the films, giving the films a “boyhood” type vibe. Although all the films will ha ve the same themes and feature Pim as the same character, they will change tone and vibe as we get to the 3rd film: “slowmotion superstars®”, light years ahead on a different planet as far as the trilogy goes. 
“Hail Tiger King®” the 2nd film and  “Slowmotion Superstars®” are currently completing post production. Release dates are expected for 2025 through early 2026 respectively.

Synopsis:
Set against the exotic beauty and enchanting ancient culture of Cambodia, two young girls embark upon a journey of yearning in search of the family they never had. Carrying with them an optimistic joy and infectious love for life, they set out unaware of the dangers and hardships of life on the streets.


Pim, a strong independent girl on the cusp of adolescence, and her younger 'sister' Chamron, share a special bond, having grown up together without parents. When financial trouble looms at the orphanage, they decide to run away and find a better life. Travelling through sweeping green rice fields and stunning panoramic vistas of rural Cambodia, they slowly drift toward the city.


Here amongst the noisy busy streets, speckled with homeless children and beggars bereft of limbs, are the human remnants of the fallen Khmer Rouge regime. The urban kaleidoscope is awash with jostling traffic, bustling markets, and an endless sea of faces. It leaves the girls searching for salvation, struggling for charity to survive.


Alone and against the world they meet Kith, a knight in shining Ray-Bans, cool as the day is long and larger than life. He is an older boy, a natural born hustler, streetwise and savvy.  Kit takes them under his wing, teaching them how to survive as the three drifters travel toward the sea. Slowly Pim and Kith fall for each other, discovering the love for which they have been searching.


On this journey of unconscious self-discovery, they experience the world without any filters, as only a child could: beautiful, vibrant and exciting, but also daunting and confusing. Through the people they meet and their stories, the children gain an insight into their history and culture, embracing the true beauty of this country, its people.


In this land of contradictions it will be the children that lead the way back.

Synopsis:

"Does our past affect our future? Are we so jaded that our past loves keep us from ever loving freely ever again? A tormented cruel cycle of life." 
 
Kith, an attractive Cambodian man early 30’s, is living the life of working to survive, not living to live. As a child Kith went on a magical adventure that changed his life forever.
 
He daydreams of the past, the future, and somewhere in between. Never living in the present. We cut back and forth between all of his journeys, and experiences.
 
When he was young and full of life, he met two young girls Pim and Chamron, going on a road trip/journey of a lifetime. Never to let go of this first love.
 
Kith now back from the road trip, goes on his biggest hustles ever, with his best friend Pov. 
 
There in this "home alone" style of comedy and cuteness, they rob the rich blind, to give to the poor. Doing all they know in their crazy mixed up third world life.
 
One day on a hustle that goes terribly wrong, they get seperated to never see eachother again. Another experience that will affect Kith for the rest of his life.
 
Kith visits a temple regularly, the temple that he, Pim, and Chamron promised each other to meet every khmer new year. He goes year after year, until he is an adult, hoping one day Pim will show up.
 
She never does, he holds on forever. 
 
Now older, Pim is afraid of what she has become and will never show her true self again. Even though she is in pain, and missing, longing for the true love she experienced a lifetime ago. 
 
Life is never what we expect. Life never gives us what we want, but what we need. It is up to us to choose what to do with it.  
 
Will Pim and Kith ever meet again? Is there hope? Does any of it matter? One day we will all be free.

An ACW story or sorts
South East Asia. Navi: a daughter to a Hindu goddess, Bunny: a toy that has become human, Pim: a prostitute going back in time, and one bad cowboy demon are about to do a babyschool heist. Thrown in a few more bad, maybe people, from another time space. What could go wrong? Everything and more!
Smack in the middle of an exotic remote jungle village, the super score is about to go down, with everybody in chaos comedy mode, trying to figure out what is, and what could be. Time is of essence.
They succeed, to only be double, criss-crossed, super f**ked by an entity unbeknownst to all of them. The very wrong marks from a different time space. One quite easy smash and grab, becomes their worst nightmare.
Navi and Bunny, desperate for answers, make side hustles with people/ things that are evil as evil can be, only to start another chain of events that will change their life forever. A mixed up world out of control.
Run, run and begin again. Danger, excitement, creatures of the night, ghost of yesterday, a poison death, a bag of severed heads, time space jumps, red skies, and replicas from another universe. Fairy-tale’s come to life, only to see the horror of living in a unknown universe of hate.
They end up at safe house,(five star hotel) only for things to flip switch again, and again.  A nightmare with no beginning or end in sight.
Will they escape? Can they survive? Who are they? What does our existence even mean?
Family, betrayal, and a crazy ass adventure make this a surreal ride of a this lifetime or any lifetime. To be continued!!
Think “Stranger Things” jungle style, meets “Harry Potter” very dark style, meets ”The Lost Boys” Asian style, meets “Charlie’s Angels” Asian style, directed by David Lynch, Wong Kar Wai, and Spike Lee on a psychedelic acid trip. What the f*ck is right!

Think All in the Family meets Swingers meets the Archies on acid and crack with a little One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest thrown in for good measure.
A black comedic adventure into the surreal crazy mixed up world of Josh and Silo and their freaky friends, jerked up love lives, and hustling ways.
AN ABSTRACT PAINTING IN THE WORLD OF CONTROLLED FILMMAKING!!
Josh and Silo, hipsters, pop-culture babies, best friends since they can remember, sit around their motor home at a trailer park overlooking the beautiful Pacific Ocean, talking about almost nothing. Questioning their lives and always wondering:
Who’s a pedophile?Why did you shag my mother?Where do you go when your guinea pig is gone?What do you do when your wet dream girl turns out to be a transsexual?
Everyday, weird friends (porno-stars, transsexuals, mongoloids, sex kittens, etc.) drop by making their somewhat normal white trash life fade into the surreal world of what some may call disturbing, nuts, strange, and in an odd sort way extremely funny.
One day they realize the junkyard they run isn’t bringing in the income they need to exist, and I do mean exist. These slacker, white trash, beatnik style “kids” have to come up with some wacky hustles and scams to get them out of their predicament and keep on existing. And as always, they do.
Inspired by Jules and Jim, Josh and Silo’s love life soon begins to get convoluted by love and a woman, Kate. After many attempts by Kate to be a lover to one of them, she realizes fate has taken it’s toll and if she wants one she has to have the other. Menage a’ trois style without the sex, platonic together and intimate apart?
Josh and Silo are hipsters caught in a make believe skewed world where everything goes and nothing is sacred. It is a world made up of what most would call broken taboos. They are free to do whatever they want because they are Josh and Silo, the hip hipsters who are going nowhere fast but having a hell of a time doin it.

faded young gods®

an HJ anthology+ story.

writer/producer
forest wise

Françoise lamure’. Everyone wants her. Everyone needs her. Two jaded LA hustlers are hired by a super wealthy family to track down their daughter somewhere in Asia but where & why? 
 
They’ll search anywhere, everywhere, because she’s the answer, she’s it, the prize..
 
We will meet different characters along the way; Buddhist monks, Thai hookers, Indian orphans, X pats, street hustlers, albino chief liars, etc. etc.
 
Picture this: The cold clean air above the mountains of Nepal. A clue here, a lie there. An Indian street guide, a trickster, an albino witch doctor. A glimpse, a hint, then a boat ride on the beautiful coastline of the Thailand beaches, then down the jungle route in the papua New Guinea rain forest, across the great wall of china, over the mountains through the jungle, down the river and start again. 
 
Soon, they find the prize, only to find love and never look back. J. loves her, she loves him. They find the meaning of true real love. B. loves her but nobody will ever know, until it’s too late.  B. wants to get paid to bring her back, collect the reward (cash) and it tests the levels of loyalty, friendship and sacrifice.
 
Conflict: love  VS. money. Friendship VS. love, who, what will win.
 
As Butch and Sundance romanced and danced their way through these scary situations, our guys pull off coup after coup through language and cultural barriers, speaking and not speaking the native 
tongues and charming the unwanting.
 
The chase goes on and on...only to culminate at the end of the world where everyone is questioned, questions, and only a few are set free.



I wanna be adored: a gorgeous suicide

an HJ anthology+ story.

writer/producer
forest wise

Pony standing up against a window looking down at the city of lights, Los Angeles, thinking how miserable his life is.
 
He is getting mentally prepared to sleep with a girl who paid him for joining her for the night, he has no idea how much his life is going to change within the next 120 days.
 
Fighting against a cheated husband, fighting his feelings for an impossible love, and, most of all, fighting against a lethal disease inside his body. Pony struggles to find out who he can trust, who his friends are and who is in control, him or the universe.
 
Pony realizes quickly that he and others gained control over his life and his only goal is to gain his ordinary life back again. He tries not to question the instructions he receives, but to follow all of them as best as he can. 
 
He ends up in India. And yet, he is far away from influencing his situation, depending solely on their mercy – and on the cell phone they gave to him to wait for instructions. 
 
LA, India and Hong Kong are the locations of this story full of greed, friendship, power, intrigue, blackmailing and life threatening situations. And a love, stronger than Pony has ever experienced, a love stronger than most have experienced! 
 
The film starts in a quite postmodernist way, before the story line becomes more and more a thriller in a James Bond style without showing Pony as a super agent, but a normal guy caught up in a world of chaos. No James Bond here.
 
The love story is a key part of the film and influences Pony’s way to act and feel during these pace and hover hustles. 
 
It is his new found love for Hope- a beautiful Asian woman, that is an angel to many, and devil to some. An angel which gives him the possibility to overcome his fate, but it is also this love that makes him almost lose his mind. 
 
Who will survive? What does it mean to trust in a world of lies? 
 
At the end of the day everybody wants to be ”adored”.

hustling jesus®: (A) and (B) 

part of planned anthology.

writer/producer
forest wise

synopsis:
This is not your ordinary ”popculture-nihilistic-genXadults & millennials-with-guns-screwing-people-over- black comedy- action- drama film”. Well, to be honest, it is. But it has a lot of other layers i.e: art, politics, history, literature, poetry, music and religion! And the infinite theme of love. A film with intellectual thoughts about existence, moral illusions and the overwhelming feelings of apathy in the new millennium.  
 
The first film in a crazy lovely cinematic planned anthology.

A gang of hustlers ready to scam the world consisting of benny, their smart and ruthless leader; emma, a strong woman who is in charge but very much questioning her existence; vex the womanizing art lover; cherry the supervixen; pony the pop-culture trendy dumbass. 
 
The gang's employer is black tiger, runs the world,  a “Godfather” type,  who lives in South America, giving them missions all over the world. Sometimes the country is only a backdrop,  and sometimes it's directly connected to the story.   However this gang more often than not takes matters into their own hands creating their own rules, bordering on suicidal behavior. Living in fear and passion the gang begins to question the meaning of their existence. Benny is at odds with it all. He loves Emma with all his heart. Emma wonʼt give into love, when all the gang do is equated with hate.
 
They all have a secret that lets them live what seems like forever. 

Sistine Chapel; Italy to the serengeti  in Africa and back again.  Love is not easy, 
Living is harder.



shot out®

a graphic novel + tv series

writer/producer
forest wise

a graphic novel come alive, with no place to exist in this faded reality.

Los Angeles: 2069?
In the year...well forget the year.  Sometime in the future. An epidemic, City Scape Disease has wiped out most of the plants, animals, vegetables, and minerals.

Some people survived, some died, and others, they just mutated. The city is now a post-apocalyptic visual hell.
The epidemic was Government initiated, they wanted the perfect world, what they got was a mixed up reality. 
The police force is still in existence, along with the other government propaganda. 
Crime has been stabilized at an average percentage for the time.       

The Government has taken ex-cons and made them into police, they are known as Skinners.
These experiments are an attempt to give the people a fair shake in life? Or maybe control them for an eternity?
                                     
Our story begins with Crash and Johnny: two hip cool Skinners, best friends/ brothers from different mothers, who hate more than anything their circumstance/situation (they'd rather be shagging women or jackin the latest CYB-Ex game).

A sadistic killer, Wacky the Clown, is on the loose brutally slaying people who are good and pure. After many screw ups on the force, Crash and Johnny have no choice but to capture Wacky the Clown or they will be thrown back into 
Max-Tech prison.

As they realize their dead end situation, nothing is left but to snap into overdrive like real super cops on acid. Solving the case? With characters abound, "Shot Öut’s” insane/wacky theme, unique style, and the mystery of who the hell Wacky the Clown is, makes it a psychotic treat for everyone lost in their nightmares in a city that is so, so Shot Öut...

always there baby®

writer/producer
forest wise

Everyone is born with the right to love and be loved.”

always there baby, a hip love story, taking you to San Francisco, 
India and Paris. Worlds apart, but in the same universe.

A contemporary tale about a group of friends unraveling love, life and the meaning of their existence.  Nico (a novelist) and his sister Alex (a lost free spirit) have a dark secret that deprives them from maintaining any kind of loving relationship.

Sometimes you have to let go of the idea of what love was to find out what love is.  

Thrown into the midst of this love carousel are a host of off-kilter characters that add spice, dimension, complicate matters and give a simple love story an edge that hasnʼt been felt before, or ever again.

And in the end everything is...always there baby.
